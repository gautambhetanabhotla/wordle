# Play wordle in your terminal!

For now, the game is a bit different from classic wordle. The word need not be 5 letters long (word length will be specified), and you can take any number of guesses. Lower the number of guesses, the better, I guess.

## To play, run the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/gautambhetanabhotla/wordle
cd wordle
make
./wordle
```
